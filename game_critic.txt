The original Prince of Persia (1989) was pretty groundbreaking for its time. The smooth, lifelike animations and the mix of platforming with puzzle-solving made it stand out from a lot of other games back then. 
The 60-minute countdown gave the whole rescue mission a real sense of urgency, forcing you to think ahead and move with purpose. It wasn’t just about jumping from platform to platform—it was about doing it under pressure.
That said, it could also be pretty frustrating. The controls had a noticeable delay between pressing a button and seeing the prince react, which could throw off your timing. 
On top of that, there weren’t any checkpoints within the rooms, so one wrong move meant starting over from scratch while the timer kept ticking. It turned what could have been a smooth experience into something that felt repetitive and stressful at times.
Still, Prince of Persia showed both the good and bad sides of early game design. The time limit gave it intensity and made every second count, but it also punished players who preferred to explore without rushing. Later entries in the series managed to fix a lot of these issues—tighter controls, checkpoints, and better pacing—making the experience feel much more balanced and enjoyable.
Looking back, I think the original game is a great example of how much small design decisions can shape the player’s experience. Even though it had its flaws, it set the stage for the rest of the series and inspired many games that came after it. For me, the charm of Prince of Persia lies in that mix of tension and creativity—it’s a reminder that sometimes, even a little frustration can make a victory feel that much sweeter.
